# Azure-infra-portfolio  
📘 Este portafolio también está disponible en [español](.README.md)

Technical portfolio as a freelance DevOps specialist focused on **infrastructure automation** using Terraform, Ansible, and Azure deployments.

## 🎯 Why do I offer these services?

I don't offer automation, infrastructure, and deployment solutions just because they're “trendy.”

I do it because I understand how frustrating it is to work with environments that are misconfigured, undocumented, insecure, and difficult to maintain.

My goal is to help you build well-organized, reproducible, and automated systems that **you can understand, maintain, and scale without vendor lock-in**.

I believe in clean, well-documented, and transparent work.  
That’s why I combine tools like **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and **GitHub Actions**, and I get involved in every project seriously and actively.

🚀 Less improvisation. More control. More time for what really matters.
