# **Azure Infrastructure Portfolio**  
📘 *This portfolio is also available in [Spanish](README.md)*  

Technical portfolio as a freelance **DevOps** specialist in infrastructure automation using **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and deployments on **Azure**.  

---

## 🎯 **Why I offer these services**  
I don’t provide automation, infrastructure, and deployments just because they’re “trendy.”  

I do it because I know the cost of working with poorly configured, undocumented, and insecure environments.  

My goal is to help you have **well-organized, reproducible, and automated systems** that you can understand, maintain, and scale without depending on anyone else.  

I believe in well-executed, documented, and transparent work.  
That’s why I combine tools like **Terraform, Ansible, and GitHub Actions**, and I take a serious, hands-on approach to every project.  

🚀 *Less improvisation. More control. More time for what matters.*
