# **Azure Infrastructure Portfolio**  
 
Hi, I'm Samuel. **DevOps** on Azure: I automate infrastructure with Terraform + Ansible and deployments with CI/CD, leaving everything observable with Prometheus/Grafana.
I learned by riding and breaking into real labs and projects; Today I work to make environments reproducible, safe and documented.

Technical portfolio as a freelance **DevOps** specialist in infrastructure automation using **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **CI/CD**, **Docker** and deployments on **Cloud**.
